### Notes

-	After renaming the `App.xaml` file, I received the following error:

	```none
	error CS5001: Program does not contain a static 'Main' method suitable for an entry point
	```

-	I found this StackOverflow answer which suggested, that I should right-click and set the build action
	to application definition in the properties.
