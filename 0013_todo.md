### Features

-	Add a shortcut to focus query field and select all the text in it.

	-	Automatically lose focus when query is submitted.

-	When using tab key to go to the raw query field select all the text in it.

-	Add a shortcut to navigate back.

-	Create a Visual Studio extension that allows filtering the logs.

	-	Output the raw text and beware of multi-line output.

	-	Ability to set log levels afterwards and disable filters.

		-	Default to builtin application filters.

		-	I don't know if `Microsoft.Extension.Logging` supports logging everything even if log level not enabled.

	-	Research how to lift state up to the debugger.
		Essentially, I need a custom log provider that is understood by the extension.

-	Add tag tree search.

-	Allow linking related notes.

	-	Add `@<uuid>` syntax into the search.

-	There should be some sort of category tag that is like a folder.
	By enforcing it to be one I can still organize the repository as a folder structure.

-	Normalize the text in `SearchService`.

	-	Remove quotes before matching search.

	-	Remove brackets before matching search.

### Tweaks

-	Do the placeholder text properly.

-	Deal with `PageData.Details=null`.

-	Dispatch events in the backend without depending on frontend.

	-	Synchronization needs to be ensured, the cancellation tokens do have an id?

	-	Alternatively, I can wrap the dispatcher into a service.

### Bugs

-	After startup the first click registers in the wrong location.

### Ideas

-	I could implement this as extension for Visual Studio Code.
	Then I can simply use Markdown files as input which makes it very easy to edit them.
	That also makes backups very simple since I can just use Git.

	-	Essentially, I just need to maintain an index and restrict how the files are edited.

	-	This could be done by creating a fake file system that it's opening files from.

	-	I can simply pin this view, similar to how I am pinning `_typos.toml` right now.

-	Brainstorm use-cases.

-	Add possibility to link to Stack Overflow page which could be indexed as well?
