### Tweaks

-	Add a shortcut to focus query field and select all the text in it.

-	When using tab key to go to the raw query field select all the text in it.

-	Add a shortcut to navigate back.

-	Create a Visual Studio extension that allows filtering the logs.

	-	Output the raw text and beware of multi-line output.

	-	Ability to set log levels afterwards and disable filters.

		-	Default to builtin application filters.

		-	I don't know if `Microsoft.Extension.Logging` supports logging everything even if log level not enabled.

		Essentially, I need a custom log provider that is understood by the extension.
