### Tweaks

-	Add a shortcut to focus query field and select all the text in it.

	-	Automatically lose focus when query is submitted.

-	When using tab key to go to the raw query field select all the text in it.

-	Add a shortcut to navigate back.

-	Create a Visual Studio extension that allows filtering the logs.

	-	Output the raw text and beware of multi-line output.

	-	Ability to set log levels afterwards and disable filters.

		-	Default to builtin application filters.

		-	I don't know if `Microsoft.Extension.Logging` supports logging everything even if log level not enabled.

	-	Research how to lift state up to the debugger.
		Essentially, I need a custom log provider that is understood by the extension.

### Ideas

-	I could implement this as extension for Visual Studio Code.
	Then I can simply use Markdown files as input which makes it very easy to edit them.
	That also makes backups very simple since I can just use Git.

	-	Essentially, I just need to maintain an index and restrict how the files are edited.

	-	This could be done by creating a fake file system that it's opening files from.

	-	I can simply pin this view, similar to how I am pinning `_typos.toml` right now.
