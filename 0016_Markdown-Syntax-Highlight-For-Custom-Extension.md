### Notes

-	I want to use the `.page` file extension and associate that with the Markdown editor.

-	According to this resource, this can be done in:

	```none
	Tools > Options > Text Editor > File Extensions
	```

	However, there are many editor types missing from that list.

### Tasks

-	Ask on StackOverflow why there are editors missing from that list.
